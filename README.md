# World_Of_Tanks
THIS IS MY PERSONAL PROJECT ♛

● OVERVIEW:

I made this project so that I could pass the Softuni - Spring Advanced course.

My app is written in the Spring framework, and I've used the best practices I've learned at Softuni!

● FEATURES: 

✔ MySQL database, JPA connection implemented

✔ Spring Security

✔ I use model mapper

✔ I have a localization interceptor, I can change the language of
some of the buttons

✔ I have an smtp server, for local email testing, I use DOCKER to run the server

✔ I have exception handling, for REST

✔ I have Logging Interceptor, it shows me some simple logs

✔ I have validations for every single form

✔ I have a TankSpecification with which I am not obliged to fill in all the fields to find a tank, I can optionally fill in (I USE IT FOR THE SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY)

✔ I have a Scheduler that uses CRON, every 12 hours if I have tanks I get 100 blood added

✔ I have a Maintance Interceptor which between 23 and 00 does not allow me to use the application

✔ I have overridden pages like 404 and 500 so the user doesn't get ugly errors

✔ I have a javascript that, through fetch, calls something from the RestController and in this way I can, depending on what category id a tank has
the picture changes

✔ The Web Application is RESPONSIVE

✔ The user could choose from two roles: ADMIN and USER

✔ There is 62% line coverage for the tests

✔ Depending on what category the tank is, he gets bonus damage when attacking
